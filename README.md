# Helmet_Detection-Deep_Learning

This a web based application which consist **Deep Learning** things in the backend.

In this project we will give an image as an input and the application will predict that human which is in input image , is wearing the helmet or not.

We can modify this idea and can use in traffic signals. So there are some special cameras which can capture the image of that. If person is not wearing the helmet then camera will catch the image of the vehicle, so that traffic police can know the number plate and charge on the owner.


**For this project, Convolutional Neural Network is used.

(ImageDataGenerator is used for data augmentation. (If we don't have more images then we can generate from them))
